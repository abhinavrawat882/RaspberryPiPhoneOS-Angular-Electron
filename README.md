# RaspberryPiPhone OS (Under Development)

This Projec AIMS to create a Mobile Like Os for Raspberry Pi Using Angular and Electron.

<h2> Ok! Calling it an Os is not right. But rather an Application layer that makes it look like phone OS</h2>

But using Angular allows Easy development for people who dont have tooo indepth knowledge but still want to make cool looking devices and tinker with it.
